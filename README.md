## About
A curated list of awesome inventors who are alive and well, documenting and sharing their knowledge on a regular basis. The list is not organised into categories because that's what makes inventors awesome! Their interests and work span across multiple technical and disciplinary areas.

## Contributing
There is no strict definition of "inventor" - but I personally think they're awesome if: 

1. Their work is prolific and spans multiple technical areas (ie. programming, electronics, robotics, chemistry, etc.)
2. They document their process of design or experimentation as a work-in-progress.
3. They present their information concisely and chronologically.

Pull requests are welcome!
